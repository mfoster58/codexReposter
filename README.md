# codexReposter
This is a simple serverless web app that utilizes the Soundcloud API to automatically repost tracks with the #codex-collective tag to the official Codex Collective Soundcloud account. 

ISSUES:
Can't seem to query the tag if the track has not hit 'popular tracks' tab yet. Opened a github issue with soundcloud: https://github.com/soundcloud/api/issues/374
